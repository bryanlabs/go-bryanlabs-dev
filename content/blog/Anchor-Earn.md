### Understanding Anchor Protocol 

Anchor is a decentralized savings protocol built on the Terra Blockchain. It serves as a money market between the lender and the borrower. Lenders can earn up to 20% APY on their stablecoin which is pretty much unheard of. Borrowers can lock up [Bonded Assets](https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/protocol/bonded-assets-bassets) as collateral to borrow stablecoins. The protocol also offers other ways to earn.

### How it Works 

The user that lends their Terra stablecoin (UST) to the Anchor protocol is also known as the Depositor. The Depositors receive aUST in return for their deposit allowing them to collect interest by just holding on to them. This newly aquired aUST can also be used as collateral to buy assets in other protocols like [Mirror](https://mirrorprotocol.app/#/trade).  



### Ways to Earn 
- Deposit: Easiest way. Simply deposit UST into Anchor and earn 20% APY.
- Borrow: Yes Borrow! You can actually earn from borrowing UST. Rewards are distributed in the ANC token. 
- Staking: Users can stake the native ANC token to receieve staking rewards.
- Liquidity: Users can earn rewards by staking ANC-UST LP tokens.
