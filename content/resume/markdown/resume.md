Experience
----------

**Owner @ Bryanlabs:** October 2018 - Present

As a small business owner, I learned that I also love business.  Here are some of those experiences:

* Understanding US tax code has become a passion of mine. Simple things like, using form 2553 to elect scorp status to split income into a W2 and K1 to save on FICA.  These IRS forms are very similar to the Technical RFC's I read and contributed to back when I was a PKI engineer in love with RFC 2560. I enjoy this legalistic aspect of both protocols, and the legal system.
* I learned alot about investments too.  The fact that one could use their scorp to adopt a solo 401K plan, then have that plan purchase an LLC, and then do self directed investing.  Back in 2020 I created Self Directed 401K, IRA, HSA LLCs, and made crypto investments.
* Being the manager of these 4 companies required that I learn how to do the book keeping too.  I learned all about how use systems that manage payroll and books.  I use Quick Books Online to manage 6 different sets of books.  I put a lot of effort into creating clean simple to understand P&Ls, balance sheets, cash flows.  
* I have experience writing proposals, my company even won a grant this year from the ethereum foundation based on a proposal i submitted. 

**Defi Engineer @ Bryanlabs:** October 2020 - Present

During my time at Bryanlabs, I also had a focus on using Defi:

* I started off by learning about ethereum and it's need to migrate to proof of stake.  Being technical I decided to become an ethereum2 validator.  I participated in Medalla, Spadina, Zinken, and Pyrmont testnets. I also was part of the Serenity Launch and still am an active validaor. https://app.poap.xyz/scan/danb.eth
* A college and me submitted and won a grant to the ethereum foundation for the eth-docker project. http://eth-docker.net/  https://github.com/eth2-educators/eth2-docker and we still actively develop it.
* On Ethereum I read white papers, and used many Dapps to include.  AAVE, Uniswap,1inch catnip, synthetix, dYdX, opensea
* On Binance Smart Chain I used Pancake Swap, Venus, autofarm, pancakebunny, jetfuel finance, yeild watch, linear finance
* I have run a Theta guardian node, and edge node
* I have provided liquidity on several decentralized Exchanges, and participated in various farms.
* I'v spent  a lot of time keeping up with the hype and trends too.  Daily consumer of crypto banter, elliotrades, dan teaches crypto, altcoin daily, bankless.
* Lately I have been very interested in Cardano and am excited for their alonzo launch introducing smart contracts.
* I have done some work on chainlink as well.  Mostly from an Architecture standpoint. A college of mine won 2nd place in the chainlink olympics, and consulted me to help design the AWS Architecture.
