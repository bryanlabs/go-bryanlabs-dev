{\bf Owner @ Bryanlabs:} October 2018 - Present

As a small business owner, I learned that I also love business. Here are
some of those experiences:

\startitemize[packed]
\item
  Understanding US tax code has become a passion of mine. Simple things
  like, using form 2553 to elect scorp status to split income into a W2
  and K1 to save on FICA. These IRS forms are very similar to the
  Technical RFC's I read and contributed to back when I was a PKI
  engineer in love with RFC 2560. I enjoy this legalistic aspect of both
  protocols, and the legal system.
\item
  I learned alot about investments too. The fact that one could use
  their scorp to adopt a solo 401K plan, then have that plan purchase an
  LLC, and then do self directed investing. Back in 2020 I created Self
  Directed 401K, IRA, HSA LLCs, and made crypto investments.
\item
  Being the manager of these 4 companies required that I learn how to do
  the book keeping too. I learned all about how use systems that manage
  payroll and books. I use Quick Books Online to manage 6 different sets
  of books. I put a lot of effort into creating clean simple to
  understand P&Ls, balance sheets, cash flows.\crlf
\item
  I have experience writing proposals, my company even won a grant this
  year from the ethereum foundation based on a proposal i submitted.
\stopitemize

{\bf Defi Engineer @ Bryanlabs:} October 2020 - Present

During my time at Bryanlabs, I also had a focus on using Defi:

  I started off by learning about ethereum and it's need to migrate to
  proof of stake. Being technical I decided to become an ethereum2
  validator. I participated in Medalla, Spadina, Zinken, and Pyrmont
  testnets. I also was part of the Serenity Launch and still am an
  active validaor. https://app.poap.xyz/scan/danb.eth
\item
  A college and me submitted and won a grant to the ethereum foundation
  for the eth-docker project. http://eth-docker.net/
  https://github.com/eth2-educators/eth2-docker and we still actively
  develop it.
\item
  On Ethereum I read white papers, and used many Dapps to include. AAVE,
  Uniswap,1inch catnip, synthetix, dYdX, opensea
\item
  On Binance Smart Chain I used Pancake Swap, Venus, autofarm,
  pancakebunny, jetfuel finance, yeild watch, linear finance
\item
  I have run a Theta guardian node, and edge node
\item
  I have provided liquidity on several decentralized Exchanges, and
  participated in various farms.
\item
  I'v spent a lot of time keeping up with the hype and trends too. Daily
  consumer of crypto banter, elliotrades, dan teaches crypto, altcoin
  daily, bankless.
\item
  Lately I have been very interested in Cardano and am excited for their
  alonzo launch introducing smart contracts.
\item
  I have done some work on chainlink as well. Mostly from an
  Architecture standpoint. A college of mine won 2nd place in the
  chainlink olympics, and consulted me to help design the AWS
  Architecture.
